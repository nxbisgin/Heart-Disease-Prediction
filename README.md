# HeartDiseasePrediction

The dataset for this project is the Heart Disease UCI dataset from Kaggle. The goal of the project is building an ML model that predicts the presence of heart disease (binary classification) in a given patient based on the available features.

Using decision tree and random forest and optimizing the hyper parameters, I aimed to increase the sensitivity of the model, thus increasing the proportion of actual positive cases that are correctly identified.
